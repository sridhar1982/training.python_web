Course Outline
==============

This course takes place over 10 sessions. Each session is three hours long.
Each session contains lecture material and exercises you will type at a python
prompt. Each session has associated assignments which you will complete
between sessions.

Session 1 - TCP/IP and Sockets
------------------------------

We will begin with a disucssion of the fundamental concepts and structures
that underly the internet and networked computing. We'll learn about the
TCP/IP stack (Internet Protocol Suite) and gain some insights into how that
model manifests in real life. We will then dive into sockets and learn how to
use them to communicate between processes on a single machine, or across a
network.

Along the way, we'll build a basic Echo server and client to demonstrate the
processes we've learned. By the end of the session, we'll be sending messages
and receiving replies.

Session 2 - Web Protocols
-------------------------

Protocols are the languages of the Internet. They govern how machines speak to
one another. We will focus on finding both the similarities and differences
between protocols. Can you use the inherent qualities of each to determine
which is appropriate for a given purpose?

Along the way, we'll build a simple web server. Using the HTTP protocol and
extending what we learned in the previous session we'll create an HTTP server
that allows us to serve files and directories from our own computers. By the
end of the day, you'll be browsing your filesystem with your own web browser.

Session 3 - APIs and Mashups
----------------------------

The internet is a treasure trove of information. But meaning can be hard to
find among all that data. Mashups offer a way to combine data from disparate
sources in order to derive meaning. Data online can be offered in forms ripe
for consumption. APIs built in XMLRPC, SOAP or REST offer rich tools for
extraction, but even simple websites can be scraped using tools like
BeautifulSoup.

We'll explore the differences between various 'Web Services' formats, learning
how to serve information and consume it. We'll also explore using BeautifulSoup
to help extract information from the sea of HTML in the wild.

Along the way, we'll create a mashup of our own, using the tools we learn to
build a script that can produce derived meaning out of data we find online.

Session 4 - CGI and WSGI
------------------------

In this class we will explore ways of moving data from HTTP requests into the
dynamic scripts that process data. We will begin by looking at the original
specification for passing data, CGI (Common Gateway Interface). We'll look at
the benefits and drawbacks of the specification, and use it to create some
simple interactions.

Then we will investigate a more modern take on the same problem, WSGI (Web
Services Gateway Interface). We'll see the ways in which WSGI is similar to
CGI, and look at the ways in which it differs. We'll create a simple interaction
using WSGI and see what benefits and drawbacks it confers.

Session 5 - Frameworks and Flask
--------------------------------

In this class we learn about using frameworks to help us reach our goals. We
will learn what makes up a framework and some criteria for evaluating which is
the right one for you.

After an introduction to the idea of frameworks, we'll look at a specific
implementation of a *microframework*, `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_.
We'll install the framework and take a look at how it works. What does it have
in common with work we've already done?

Along the way we'll learn about Jinja2, the templating language that Flask
uses, and a bit about the DBAPI2 and communicating with SQL databases from
within Python.

`Lecture Slides <presentations/session05.html>`_


Session 6 - A Flask Application
-------------------------------

In this class we will exercise our new-won knowledge by building a small
application using Flask. We'll write templates and forms, persist data,
implement login and logout. When we're done, we'll have a fully-functional
microblog.

We'll use a test-driven development style as we go. We'll decide the
functionality we need, write tests to prove it works, and then write the code
to make those tests pass. We'll be using the ``unittest`` module from the
Python Standard Library.

Along the way, we'll learn a bit more about how flask operates in a real
application. We'll learn some more about the Jinja2 templating language, and
we'll learn to tie the transactions of our database interaction to the cycles
of request and response.

Session 7 - Intro to Django
---------------------------

In this class we'll get introduced to arguably the most popular full-stack
Python web framework, Django. We'll install the framework, learn about how to
get it running and how to get started creating your very own app.

We'll be learning about the Django ORM and how Django Models can help shield
developers from much of the complexity of SQL. We'll learn how to use the
tools Django provides to explore and interact with your models while designing
them. We'll also get a brief introduction to the Django admin, Django's
*killer feature*.

Along the way, we'll continue our test-driven development style: writing tests
to demonstrate the functionality we desire and then implementing code to make
them pass. We'll get a chance to see how to build tests within the framework 
offered by Django's testrunner.

`Lecture Slides <presentations/session07.html>`_


Session 8 - A Django Application
--------------------------------

In this class we'll complete our exploration of Django. We'll customize the
Django admin to help us most efficiently administer our Blog application.
We'll create and test view functions that present our application to the world
and we'll provide front-end access to forms that allow us to create, edit and
publish blog entries without needing to use the admin.

Along the way we'll learn that the Django template language is quite similar
to the Jinja2 language (in fact, Jinja2 was modelled on the Django version).
We'll also get a chance to learn a bit more about the features that the Django
test framework provides over and above the standard Python ``unittest``
library.

Finally, we'll discuss some of the strengths and weaknesses of Django.  What 
makes it a good choice for some projects but not for others.

`Lecture Slides <presentations/session08.html>`_


Session 9 - Intro to Pyramid
----------------------------

In this class we will look at a relative newcomer to the Python Web Framework
scene, Pyramid. Although the framework is a newcomer, it is represents a
combination of several projects, notably Repoze and Pylons, that have been
around for quite some time. In fact, the roots of Repoze go back to Zope, the
original Python web framework (and quite possibly the first web framework in
any language).

We will talk a bit about what makes Pyramid different from other web
frameworks. We will look at the specific problems that the creators of Pyramid
are looking to solve, and we will investigate how those decisions have
influenced the design of the framework.

Along the way, we'll learn how Pyramid works under the covers, and how this is
like and unlike other frameworks we've seen so far. We'll get started building
the Data Model and configuration structure for the wiki application we'll be 
completing in the next session.

And we'll continue focusing on test-driven development, specifying
functionality and writing tests to demostrate it before ever writing the code
that provides it.

`Lecture Slides <presentations/session09.html>`_


Session 10 - A Pyramid Application
----------------------------------

In this class we'll dive into building a real Pyramid application. We'll be
implementing a simple wiki, using traversal dispatch, ZODB persistence and
Chameleon templates. We'll get a chance to work with simple forms, see how
views work in Pyramid, and implement an ACL-based authorization scheme.

Along the way we'll be taking a good look at a very different templating
system, Chameleon. It grew out of Zope Page Templates (ZPT) and the Template
Attribute Language (TAL). It's chief advantage is that it provides structure
and variable interpolation via XML namespaced attributes. This allows you to 
write templates that load in a browser and look 'right' without needing the
framework to render them.

And we'll continue our drive for test-driven development by writing
tests that cover the functionality we want and then writing the code to make
them pass. 

By the end of the session, you'll have a fully functional wiki you can play
with. Maybe you'll use it to track the information you leared about Python
Web Development.
