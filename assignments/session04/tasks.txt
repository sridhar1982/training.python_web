Session 4 Homework
==================

Required Tasks:
---------------

The Mashup you created for the last session produces interesting data. This
session we learned how to build simple WSGI applications that expose data
using information from the request.

For your homework this week, I want you to combine the two. Using your mashup
as a data source, build a simple WSGI application that shows that data to the
user. Make it minimally interactive. A user should be able to click links or 
provide input via simple HTML forms.

Place the following in the assignments/session04 directory and make a pull
request:

Instructions
  If any extra stuff needs to be installed or executed for your application
  to work, make sure I know about it.

Your source code.
  Give me an executable python script that I can run to start a WSGI server
  serving your application.  Use the standard library wsgiref module.

Your tests.
  Last session, tests were optional.  This week they are not.

Your application should produce HTML output that I can view in a browser. That
output does not need to be attractive. Continue to focus on the mechanics of
making this work, rather than the aesthetics of making it pretty.
