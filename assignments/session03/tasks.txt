Session 3 Homework
==================

Required Tasks:
---------------

Using what you've learned this week, create a more complex mashup of some data
that interests you. Map the locations of the breweries near your house. Chart
a multi-axial graph of the popularity of various cities across several
categories.  Visualize the most effective legislators in Congress.  You have
interests, the Web has tools.  Put them together to make something.

Use the API directory at http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory to get
some ideas of data sources and what you might do with them.

Place the following in the assignments/session03 directory and make a pull
request:

A textual description of your mashup.
  What data sources did you scan, what tools did you use, what is the
  outcome you wanted to create?

Your source code.
  Give me an executable python script that I can run to get output.

Any instructions I need.
  If I need instructions beyond 'python myscript.py' to get the right
  output, let me know.

The data you produce need not be pretty, or even particularly visible. In
class we only produced a simple dictionary of values for each listing. Focus
on getting data sources combined rather than on what the output looks like.


Optional Tasks:
---------------

Write unit tests supporting the functions of your mashup script.
